<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>So, I was able to use the lovely <a href="https://github.com/akerl/githubchart">githubchart</a> gem to generate my githubchart SVG with no issues at all. It was so simple.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; gem install githubchart
&gt; githubchart -u onlymattjohnson ./github.svg
</code></pre><p>Since this was so easy I thought just dropping that in <code>cron</code> to run every 15 minutes or so would be straightforward. I get to keep hugo generating my static site and then in the background this script can just refresh the image.</p>
<p>â›” I was wrong.</p>
<p>I added the commands I needed to the an entry in <code>crontab -e</code> and then waited to see the image render. It did not. I checked my logs and I see this message (I removed some of the folder names because you don&rsquo;t need to know all that)</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>/usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/rubygems.rb:275:in `find_spec_for_exe&#39;: can&#39;t find gem githubchart (&gt;= 0.a) with executable githubchart (Gem::GemNotFoundException)
        from /usr/lib/ruby/2.7.0/rubygems.rb:294:in `activate_bin_path&#39;
        from /home/XXXXXXXXX/gems/bin/githubchart:23:in `&lt;main&gt;&#39;
</code></pre><h2 id="can-this-be-fixed">Can this be fixed?</h2>
<p>Every suggestion google through back at me involved installing <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>, which to be fair I should have already done. From there, I should let RVM setup my cron headers.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; rvm cron setup
</code></pre><p>So, I installed RVM, which was fast. Then, I installed ruby through RVM, which did not go so fast. Finally, I reinstalled <code>githubchart</code> with the new ruby being managed by RVM.</p>
<p>Now, I entered the magic command <code>rvm cron setup</code>, verified that my crontab now had the appropriate headers. I crossed my fingers ðŸ¤ž and&hellip; IT WORKED ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>So, I guess if you want to use ruby gems and cron, make sure to use RVM.</p>
