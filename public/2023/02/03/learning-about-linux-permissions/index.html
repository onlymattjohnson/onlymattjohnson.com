<h1 id="permissions">Permissions</h1>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve got this website running on a linux server which serves this out of a directory <code>/var/www/onlymattjohnson.com</code> which is owned by the <strong>www-data</strong> group. I was trying to upload the files by ftp for my user but I found that I couldn&rsquo;t write to the folder. So, I figured the folder is owned by <strong>www-data</strong> let&rsquo;s add myself to that group.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; sudo usermod -a -G www-data &lt;my_username&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now I&rsquo;m in the group but still having issues writing. Turns out linux permissions are to the owner, group members of the owner, and then everyone else. Whoopsie. I need to give this whole group writing permissions.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&gt; chmod g+w /var/www/onlymattjohnson.com
</code></pre><p>Once that was done, everything is working according to plan. If this page is up, I think we did it correctly.</p>
