      <description>Hello! Welcome to my new website. This is a first post for my updated site that I would like to begin blogging on. The site is built with Hugo using a modificatio of the Archie theme
I will be making small tweaks here and there and figuring out how to automatically deploy this to my server, but first thing is first and I&amp;rsquo;m getting the site up and running. This is a first post to allow for that.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™ve spent the better part of the last 17 years gathering, cleaning, and transforming data to find meaning and to move organizations forward. Iâ€™ve worked for non-profits, labor unions, governments, and a few universities.
Most days, I am writing SQL, building data pipelines, and modeling data. I find problems and I fix problems. Once the problems are fixed, I build reports to provide usable information to my colleagues.
I was born and raised in Chicago, but I currently live in the northwest suburbs.</description>
