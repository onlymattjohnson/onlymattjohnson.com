      <description>Oh boy. I feel like I may never truly understand how cron works compared to other task scheduling applications. Today I went through a whole mess of steps to try and get a job scheduled to automatically generate my github contributions chart.
What happened? So, I was able to use the lovely githubchart gem to generate my githubchart SVG with no issues at all. It was so simple.
&amp;gt; gem install githubchart &amp;gt; githubchart -u onlymattjohnson .</description>

      <description>So, who knows what&amp;rsquo;s a good pace for writing blog posts, but since I&amp;rsquo;m in the habit of writing up notes about new things I learn, might as well write a post even though I already put one up earlier today.
Permissions So, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this website running on a linux server which serves this out of a directory /var/www/onlymattjohnson.com which is owned by the www-data group. I was trying to upload the files by ftp for my user but I found that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write to the folder.</description>

      <description>Hello! Welcome to my new website. This is a first post for my updated site that I would like to begin blogging on. The site is built with Hugo using a modificatio of the Archie theme
I will be making small tweaks here and there and figuring out how to automatically deploy this to my server, but first thing is first and I&amp;rsquo;m getting the site up and running. This is a first post to allow for that.</description>
