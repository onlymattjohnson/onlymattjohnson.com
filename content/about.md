Iâ€™ve spent the better part of the last 17 years gathering, cleaning, and transforming data to find meaning and to move organizations forward. Iâ€™ve worked for non-profits, labor unions, governments, and a few universities.

Most days, I am writing SQL, building data pipelines, and modeling data. I find problems and I fix problems. Once the problems are fixed, I build reports to provide usable information to my colleagues.

I was born and raised in Chicago, but I currently live in the northwest suburbs. I am married to an amazing and [talented](http://www.glorioustomato.com) woman named Jill.
