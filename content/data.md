This page holds a variety of personal data metrics that I'm interested in tracking. I think this may be where Hugo becomes a little tricky for me, but so far it is working for what I need.

## Github

A summary of github contributions that I've made. This chart is generated with the very helpful ruby gem [githubchart](https://github.com/akerl/githubchart) by [Les Aker](https://akerl.org/). I used to use the [rshah API](https://ghchart.rshah.org/) to generate these but it stopped working. I have a [cron job]({{<ref "/posts/2023-07-18-oh-my-cron.md">}}) running every 15 minutes to refresh this.
